# Good design is LONGLAST(ing)

To create a long-lasting design you need to have a good documentation of all design assets. Longlast help you to accomplish this by giving you a simple HTML and CSS based tool.

It is not a Yeoman generator. It is not a CLI. It combines the best of both worlds.

## Installation

npm install -g generator-longlast
```
